# Yacht Hydrodynamics Data Set
<br>

1. Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the ship's performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. 

2. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity. 

3. The Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose.

**Attribute Information**

*Variations concern hull geometry coefficients and the Froude number:*

1. Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional.
2. Prismatic coefficient, adimensional.
3. Length-displacement ratio, adimensional.
4. Beam-draught ratio, adimensional.
5. Length-beam ratio, adimensional.
6. Froude number, adimensional.

*The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement:*

7. Residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement, adimensional.
